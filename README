Most of this code was developed on my own based on what we learned in-class. The following are outside resources that I used and what they were used for:
  -Microsoft Website: syntax for setting column width via AutoFit, formatting to percent inside of VBA
  -Discord with other students: suggested order of completion (run each task on its own, then run all on one sheet, then add ability to move through worksheets)
That's it for this assignment!
